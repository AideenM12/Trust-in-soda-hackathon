          * Plan

          Make the site easy to navigate by providing a navbar and using easily understandable names for the pages.

          * Implementation

          The Bootstrap navbar with a fixed top position was used. On mobile devices we also used Bootstrap to make the navbar collapse and be displayed within the hamburger sign.

          * Test

          We tested all links on all pages and with different browsers to make sure that the correct site is displayed.

          * Result

          Each site is reachable from every page and on every browser.

          * Verdict

          Working as intended.

          Give the user the opportunity to return to the homepage if an invalid URL has been entered.

          * Implementation

          ???

          * Test

          Deliberately use wrong subdomain-names.

          * Result

          The 404 page is displayed and the user can use the provided link to return to the main page.

          * Verdict

          Working as intended.
